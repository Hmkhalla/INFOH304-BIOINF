INFOH304-BIOINF PROJECT: PROTEIN SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT USING THE SMITH-WATERMAN ALGORITHM

For the perfect match, all the files are included in the folder 'exact match'.
To execute it, add in the same folder the database files: 
uniprot_sprot.fasta and its binary files with the extensions '.pin', '.psq' and '.phr'.
Run the command:  

        make
        
And then:
  
        ./test_db ./uniprot_sprot.fasta ./P00533.fasta
